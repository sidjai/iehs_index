#Integrated Environmental Health and Safety index (IEHS)

This is a design tool for chemical factory designers in the process flowsheet and conceptual design phase in the larger phase of Front End Engineering and Design (FEED). It can be used throughout the stage from an Input-Output structure to the final flowsheet alongside a rigourous technoeconmic study. It runs on MatLab and Octave with minimal system requirements. This is a redesigned index from the original EHS index by Koller et al.
