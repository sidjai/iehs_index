Due to the highly reactive nature of members of this group, we cannot state with certainty that hazardous reactions between members of this group will not occur. Powerful reducing agents may in fact react with less powerful reducing agents. Caution should be used before proceeding. Further research of comparable examples in the literature or very small scale, carefully controlled experiments may be needed to fully assess compatibility.

OXYGEN by itself - 
Oxidizing Agents WITH Oxidizing Agents:
Due to the highly reactive nature of members of this group, we cannot state with certainty that hazardous reactions between members of this group will not occur. Powerful oxidizers may in fact react with less powerful oxidizers. Caution should be used before proceeding. Further research of comparable examples in the literature or very small scale, carefully controlled experiments may be needed to fully assess compatibility.

WATER mixed with CARBON MONOXIDE - 
Reducing Agents WITH Water and Aqueous Solutions:
1) CHROMOUS CHLORIDE is stable in dry air, but oxidizes rapidly in moist air or standing water with liberation of Hydrogen. It is soluble in water.
-	The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989
2) When exposed to air, white phosphorus emits a green light and gives off white fumes. Ignites at 30 C in moist air, higher temperatures are required for ignition in dry air. 
-	The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989
3) PHOSPHORUS TRICHLORIDE fumes in air.  The chemical reacts violently with water, generating dense hydrogen chloride vapors.  In experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, in which it was mixed with water and stirred at room conditions, about 33 percent of the theoretical yield of HCl evolved as a gas in the first minute.

5) With water, sodium hydrosulfite slowly oxidizes to sodium bisulfite and later to sulfur dioxide and sodium hydroxide with evolution of heat.  The chemical may ignite combustible materials in contact with moisture or air.  Moist sodium hydrosulfite is likely to ignite upon drying. Experimental work at Argonne National Laboratory has determined that there is essentially very little SO2 gas formation; the substance, sodium hydrosulfite was quite unreactive in water.  This does not prevent SO2 formation by a catalytic mechanism, but under normal conditions sodium hyposulfite is quite unreactive.  The hydration reaction was rapid and quite exothermic.  The small change in gas volume was attributed to this heating.
